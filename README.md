# Patient Transfers

## Context
This prototype implements an emergency summary to transfer injured skiers from their medical outposts to hospitals. This summary deviates from standard forms, being closer to a narrated summary written by the medical staff.

## Entity Relationship

## Stack
1. Rails 5.3.3 (Ruby 2.6.1)
2. SQLite
3. Bootstrap (3?) TBD

## Development

Just as any Rails app:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
$ rails server
```

Go to `localhost:3000` and that's it!
